The diameter $D$ of the lens is 100 µm. Determine the wavelength $\\lambda$ and the first order focal length $f$. Estimate the depth of focus. Please explain all your assumptions.\n",

    "The file _AMS\\_DATA\\_zincite.txt_ contains information on the diffraction properties of ZnO (zincite), taken from the AMS database. The d-spacing is given in \\AA. Given a line detector, compute which lateral translation is required for different detector distances, ranging from 0.5 to 10 cm (in 0.5 cm steps), to measure the (200) reflection in the middle of the detector for photon energies between 5 and 80 keV (in 1 keV steps). By default, the middle of the detector is aligned with the undiffracted beam. Plot both distances vs. the energy in a 3D plot.  You may need the following constants: speed of light $c = 3\\cdot10^{8}$ m/s and Planck's constant $h=4.136\\cdot10^{-15}$ eV$\\cdot$s"
