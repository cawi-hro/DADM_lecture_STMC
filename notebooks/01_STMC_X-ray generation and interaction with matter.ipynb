    "The Bremsstrahlungsspectrum of an X-ray source can be approximated by Kramer's law, which relates the photon count $I$ to the wavelength $\\lambda$ emitted over the wavelength interval $d\\lambda$ by $$I(\\lambda)d\\lambda=K\\left(\\frac{\\lambda}{\\lambda_{min}}-1\\right)\\frac{1}{\\lambda^2}d\\lambda \\, .$$ $K$ is proportional to the atomic number of the metal target. Please calculate and draw/plot the spectrum for a rhodium target with an electron beam energy of $E=60$ keV. Indicate clearly how you determined $\\lambda_{min}$. You may choose an interval of $d\\lambda$=5 pm for your calculation, with a maximum of 500 pm. Please comment on what may be missing from the spectrum calculated by the Kramer's law and where."
