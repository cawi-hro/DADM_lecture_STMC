# Synchrotron Techniques for Materials Characterisation - Course 

This repository collects supplementary materials to the master's course "Synchrotron Techniques for Materials Characterisation" (STMC) given by [Berit Zeller-Plumhoff](https://www.hereon.de/institutes/metallic_biomaterials/imaging_and_data_science/team/098931/index.php.de) - University of Rostock - Chair of Data-driven Analysis and Design of Materials, Rostock, Germany. 

## Getting Started

The Jupyter notebooks are accessible in various ways

* Online as [static web pages](https://nbviewer.org/github/spatialaudio/data-driven-audio-signal-processing-lecture/blob/main/index.ipynb)
* Online for [interactive usage](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/spatialaudio/data-driven-audio-signal-processing-lecture/HEAD?labpath=index.ipynb) with [binder](https://mybinder.org/)
* Local for interactive usage on your computer

Other online services (e.g. [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com), [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/), ...) provide environments for interactive execution of Jupyter notebooks as well.
Local execution on your computer requires a local Jupyter/IPython installation.
The [Anaconda distribution](https://www.continuum.io/downloads) can be considered as a convenient starting point.
Then, you'd have to [clone/download the notebooks from Github](https://github.com/cawi-hro/DADM_lecture_STMC).
Use a [Git](http://git-scm.org/) client to clone the notebooks and then start your local Jupyter server. For manual installation under OS X/Linux please refer to your packet manager.
